# üè¶ Bank Loan Analysis Report (Power BI )

This project is a comprehensive Bank Loan Analysis Report built using  **Power BI** for visualization and analysis. The primary goal is to provide critical insights into the bank's lending portfolio, assess risk, and enable data-driven decision-making.

---

##  Project Objectives

* **Assess Portfolio Health:** Monitor the overall performance and risk profile of the loan portfolio.
* **Track Key Metrics:** Calculate and monitor core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total applications, funded amounts, and interest rates.
* **Time-Series Analysis:** Analyze performance trends using Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) metrics for all key indicators.
* **Detailed Insights:** Create a consolidated 'Details Dashboard' for accessing vital loan data, borrower profiles, and individual loan performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Monitored

The report tracks five essential KPIs, including their MTD values and MoM changes:

1.  **Total Loan Applications:** Total count of applications received.
2.  **Total Funded Amount:** Total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
3.  **Total Amount Received:** Total amount collected from borrowers.
4.  **Average Interest Rate:** Overall average interest rate across the portfolio.
5.  **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:** Average DTI to gauge borrower financial health.

##  Dashboard Structure

The project is structured around a multi-page report:

### 1. Summary Dashboard

* **Core KPIs:** Display of the five main KPIs with MoM trend indicators.
* **Good Loan vs Bad Loan Analysis:** A side-by-side comparison of 'Good Loan' and 'Bad Loan' performance based on Application Percentage, Applications, Funded Amount, and Total Received Amount.
* **Loan Status Grid View:** A comprehensive table categorized by **'Loan Status'** (e.g., Fully Paid, Current, Default) showing key metrics for each status.
